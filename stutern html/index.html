            <p>I've designed some beautiful webpages using HTML and CSS, i also enjoy developing interactive user interface. Lately though, I've found myself intentionally working on my communication skills. I have started reading and listening to others,
                taking on new habits (also found myself texting more, I'm amazed) and becoming more intentional with everything I do.</p>
